default_asyncio_mode = 'auto'# Note: As of pytest 7.1.0, asyncio_mode is deprecated and replaced with default_asyncio_modeasyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = 'function'# Note: As of pytest 7.1.0, asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope is deprecated and replaced with asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope. Also note that pytest no longer recommends setting asyncio_loop_scope for fixtures and instead recommends using 'asyncio' as a fixture. Here is an updated example of how you can use asyncio in your tests:
import asyncio
async def test_asyncio_example():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
async def test_asyncio_fixture():
    async def my_fixture():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    assert my_fixture() is not None
